# MHRWR
Package: MHRWR Type: Package Title: MHRWR Prediction of lncRNA-disease associations based on multiple heterogeneous networks ================= Description: This package implements the MHRWR algorithm based on multiple heterogeneous networks, predicting lncRNA-disease associations.  Files: 1.Dataset  1) LncFunGauSim.txt, DisSemGauSim.txt and GeneLlsGauSim.txt store lncRNA similarity matrix, disease similarity matrix, and gene similarity matrix, respectively;  2) DisLncMat.txt, GeneDisMat.txt and GeneLncMat.txt stores known disease-lncRNA association information,known gene-disease association information and known gene-lncRNA association information,respectively;  3) lncRNA_Name.txt, diseases_Name.txt and gene_name store lncRNA ids, disease ids,gene ids, respectively;  2.Code 1) pridiction.py:predict potential lncRNA-disease associations.  2) Walker.py: The main function for the algorithm.  3) CalW.py: the function of Calculating weight matrix.
